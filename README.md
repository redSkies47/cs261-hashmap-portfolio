# cs261-hashmap-portfolio

### About
This project contains two implementations of a Hashmap. For collision resolution, one implementation uses Separate Chaining and another uses Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing. It was built using the limited Dynamic Arrays and Singly Linked Lists. This portfolio project showcases my capabilities with data structures and algorithms as well as working with 25 pages of specifications. It passes the provided test cases. My work was created for the course CS 261 Data Structures using the provided starter skeleton code. 

Both Separate Chaining and Open Addressing contain the following methods:
- put()
- table_load()
- empty_buckets()
- resize_table()
- get()
- contains_key()
- remove()
- clear()
- get_keys()

Separate Chaining has an additional method:
- find_mode()

### Built With
My two implementations of Hashmap are built using Python 3.7.
